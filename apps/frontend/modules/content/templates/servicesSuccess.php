							<h5>NRI Tax services</h5>
							<p>
							The NRIs need to attend various issues relating to tax and financial affairs. The financial affairs are complex and procedure oriented. It has been made more difficult to attend to by inefficient tax laws, regulations and procedures. Many times, the NRIs do not know with whom and how to communicate to the person in Authority. There is great need of availability of services on Internet to attend all these issues from wherever NRIs are located.
							</p>
							<p>
The Non-Resident Indians come to India for pleasure, to meet relatives and friends and one finds that they waste their time at a Bank Clerk's desk, at Offices of Income-tax Department or Reserve Bank of India.
							</p>
							<p>
We assist them to attend all these issues sitting in the comforts of their home wherever they are located. They need not spend on communications; scratch their head for conflicting advice and suggestions from so called experts or persons in authority or novice alike.  							</p>
<p>
	If the NRIs are willing to pay reasonable fees they should get important matters attended in time, get correct information quickly and remain free to enjoy their stay in India.
</p>
<p>
This is what we endeavour at Groworth Real Solutions.
