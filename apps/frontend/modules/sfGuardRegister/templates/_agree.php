              An Introduction to Best Buddies International
            </div>
            <div class="sf_admin_form_row sf_admin_text">

              <p>Best Buddies is a 501(c) (3) non-profit organization whose mission is to establish a global volunteer movement that creates opportunities for one-to-one friendships, integrated employment and leadership development for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). By joining Best Buddies International, you become part of a growing movement of people with and without IDD dedicated to ensuring everyone has the opportunity to have a friend. Socialization is one of the simplest, but most often underestimated, solutions to the pattern of exclusion that people with IDD have faced for decades.</p>

              <p>You will be joining an organization that will positively impact more than 700,000 individuals this year. Best Buddies accomplishes its mission through seven unique programs: Best Buddies Middle Schools, High Schools, Colleges, Citizens, Jobs, e-Buddies, and Ambassadors. Best Buddies programs engage participants in each of the 50 United States and operate accredited international programs in more than 50 countries.</p>

              <p>Best Buddies High Schools, Colleges, and Middle Schools are the foundation of the organization with chapters at more than 1,500 campuses around the world. Best Buddies Citizens matches adults with and without IDD in one-to-one friendships. Best Buddies Jobs, our supported employment program, helps people with IDD find and keep well paying jobs. e-Buddies matches individuals with and without IDD in online friendships. Ambassadors educates and empowers people with IDD to be leaders and public speakers in their schools, communities, and workplaces, and is the next step for the disability rights movement â€“ teaching people with IDD the skills they need to successfully self-advocate.</p>

              <p>We encourage you to learn more about Best Buddies by visiting our website: www.bestbuddies.org, and on behalf of the 700,000 participants in Best Buddies, we thank you for your support.</p>
